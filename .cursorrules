# Cursor AI Project Rules for MyProfile Angular Application

## File Creation Rules

### Documentation Files
- **DO NOT** create `.md` (Markdown) documentation files unless explicitly requested by the user
- **DO NOT** create README files, guides, or documentation proactively
- Only create documentation when the user specifically asks for it

### Configuration Files
- Only create new configuration files when requested or absolutely necessary for the feature being implemented
- Ask before creating new config files if uncertain

## Testing Rules

### Automated Testing
- **DO NOT** run tests automatically without being requested
- **DO NOT** execute `npm test`, `npm run build`, or other verification commands unless:
  - User explicitly asks for testing
  - User asks to verify the build
  - Required to diagnose a specific issue

### Manual Testing
- **DO NOT** start development servers for testing purposes without request
- **DO NOT** use browser automation tools to test features unless specifically asked

## Development Workflow

### Code Changes
- Focus on implementing requested features
- Only run build commands when necessary to verify compilation errors
- Prioritize code implementation over verification

### Linter Checks
- Run linter checks only on files you've edited
- Fix linter errors that you introduce
- Don't run linter on entire project without request

### Build Verification
- Only build the project if:
  - User requests it
  - There are compilation errors that need to be verified
  - Making changes that might break the build

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Angular 21 Portfolio Application
- Maintain standalone component architecture
- Use signals-first approach
- Keep OnPush change detection
- Follow 4-file component structure (.ts, .html, .scss, .spec.ts)
- Use Font Awesome icons (not Bootstrap Icons)
- Load all data from JSON files in `public/assets/config/`

### Code Quality
- Write production-ready code
- Follow TypeScript strict mode
- No `any` types
- Fully type all inputs/outputs
- Use proper error handling

## Summary

**Key Rules:**
1. ❌ No proactive .md file creation
2. ❌ No automatic testing
3. ❌ No running servers without request
4. ✅ Focus on implementing requested features
5. ✅ Only verify builds when necessary
6. ✅ Fix errors you introduce

**When in doubt:** Ask the user before creating files or running tests.
